MERN Stack Photo Sharing App is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) for sharing photos with other users. The application allows users to upload photos, view photos uploaded by other users, and like or comment on them.

The repository includes a set of server-side and client-side code. The server-side code is built using Node.js and Express, and uses MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve user information and photos. The client-side code is built using React, and includes components for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.

The application includes features like user registration, login, and profile creation, as well as uploading and viewing photos, and liking or commenting on them. Users can also follow other users to get updates on their photo uploads and interact with them.

The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels. The repository includes detailed instructions for setting up and running the app locally.
